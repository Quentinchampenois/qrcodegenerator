# QRCode Generator

Light Rails application to convert String to QRCode easily based on [RQRCode]().

## Why ? 

This is a discover of [Rails 7]() and [turbo-streams feature](). This application only contains one route, user have a simple text input and a submit button. Idea is to provide a secure tool to create QRCode easily.

It generates a QRCode as PNG thanks to RQRCode gem.
